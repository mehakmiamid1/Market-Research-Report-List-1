<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biodegradable Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Particles</li><li>Powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biodegradable additives market features two primary types: particles and powder. Particle-based additives, often larger in size, are incorporated into various materials to improve biodegradability while enhancing physical properties like strength and durability. Powder additives, being finer and more easily mixed, allow for uniform distribution within a host material, facilitating efficient biodegradation. Both forms serve to reduce environmental impact by enabling products to decompose more readily, addressing global concerns about plastic waste and promoting sustainable practices across industries.</p></p>
