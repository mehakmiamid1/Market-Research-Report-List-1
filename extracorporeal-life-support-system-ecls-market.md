<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Life Support System (ECLS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial)</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Life Support System (ECLS) refers to medical devices used to support patients with severe cardiac or respiratory failure. The market is primarily categorized into two types: Veno-Arterial (VA) and Veno-Venous (VV) support. VA ECLS circulates blood from a vein to an artery, providing cardiac support by performing both oxygenation and circulation functions. In contrast, VV ECLS facilitates oxygenation by drawing blood from a vein and returning it to another vein, primarily assisting patients with respiratory failure. Both types are critical in life-saving emergency interventions.</p></p>
