<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporary Pacing Electrodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar Pacing Electrode</li><li>Unipolar Pacing Electrode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Temporary Pacing Electrodes market encompasses two primary types: bipolar and unipolar pacing electrodes. Bipolar pacing electrodes feature two closely positioned electrodes that facilitate localized stimulation, minimizing the risk of unintended ventricular capture. In contrast, unipolar pacing electrodes utilize a single electrode and a distant grounding point, allowing for broader stimulation zones. Each type serves specific clinical scenarios, with bipolar electrodes often preferred for precise cardiac pacing, while unipolar electrodes are typically used for more extensive pacing needs in emergency situations.</p></p>
